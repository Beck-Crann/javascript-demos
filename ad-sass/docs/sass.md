# Sass

Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled or processed into CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.  
  
Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
