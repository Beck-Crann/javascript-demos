    !+enter will give html5 template.
    Some Emmet concepts that use same syntax as CSS:
        + is the sibling selector ex. nav+ul+li gives them as siblings.
        > is the child selector ex. nav>ul>>li*6 gives them as children of the previous.
        ^ is the move up action.
        . class
        # id
    Use "Ctrl + Space" to get Emmet back.
