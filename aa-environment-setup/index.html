    Lorem is part of VSCode.
    Lorem20 will give 20 random words.
    
    Emmet is part of VSCode.
    !+enter will give html5 template.
    Some Emmet concepts that use same syntax as CSS:
        + is the sibling selector ex. nav+ul+li gives them as siblings.
        > is the child selector ex. nav>ul>>li*6 gives them as children of the previous.
    Use Ctrl+Space to get Emmet back.
